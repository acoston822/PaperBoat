# Quick Start

PaperBoat does not include any copyrighted assets.  You are required to provide a supported copy of the game.

### 1. Verify your ROM dump
US SHA1 Hash: `3837f44cda784b466c9a2d99df70d77c322b97a0`
You can verify you have dumped a supported copy of the game by using the compatibility checker at https://paperboat.equipment/.

### 2. Download PaperBoat from [Releases](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/PaperBoat/releases)

### 3. Launch the Game!
#### Windows
* Extract the zip
* Launch `paperboat.exe`

### Graphics Backends
Currently, there are three rendering APIs supported: DirectX 11 (Windows), OpenGL (all platforms), and Metal (macOS). You can change which API to use in the `Settings` menu of the menubar, which requires a restart.

If you're having an issue with crashing, you can also change the API manually in the `paperboat.cfg.json` file by finding the `"Backend": {` section and updating the backend ID and name. Be sure to use one of the valid values:

- `0` = DirectX 11 (default on Windows)
- `1` = OpenGL
- `2` = Metal (default on macOS)

# Custom Assets

Custom assets are packed in `.o2r` or `.otr` files. To use custom assets, place them in the `mods` folder.

If you're interested in creating and/or packing your own custom asset `.o2r`/`.otr` files, check out the following tools:
* [**retro - OTR and O2R generator**](https://github.com/HarbourMasters64/retro)
* [**fast64 - Blender plugin (Note that PM64 is not fully supported at this time)**](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/fast64)
